Turkish/Greek coffee is made on the stove using a very small pot. This method produces very strong, unfiltered coffee. Some people like to add sugar or other seasonings like cinnamon or cardamom right to the pot while brewing, which infuses the flavor. Like espresso, it's enjoyed from a small cup.

How it works: Water is mixed with very finely ground coffee until the mixture just starts to boil. Coffee is then transferred to a cup where the grounds settle to the bottom.

Who it's best for: Coffee drinkers who like strong coffee that's quick and easy to make.

Some brands package coffee in tea bags that can be made the same way as tea: Steeped. Specialty coffee packaged in compostable baggies makes it easy to enjoy a good, full-bodied cup of coffee on the go.

How it works: Just like a tea bag: Put the coffee sachet into a mug and add hot water. Steep for five to six minutes.

Who it's best for: Frequent travelers and those who value convenience over everything â€” you only need hot water to get a cup of coffee.

A phin is similar to a small pour-over. It's made of metal and uses finer ground beans.

How it works: Small holes on the bottom allow hot water to drip through it after it has passed through the grounds. It typically brews into a cup that is filled with a small amount of sweetened condensed milk.

Who it's best for: Single-cup coffee drinkers who like strong coffee.
