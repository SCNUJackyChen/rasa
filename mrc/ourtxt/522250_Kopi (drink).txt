Kopi (drink)
Kopi is a type of traditional coffee commonly drunk in Singapore and West Malaysia. It is a highly caffeinated black coffee served with milk and sugar. This drink originates during the British Malaya era, with Hainanese roots. It is also otherwise known as Nanyang coffee. Nanyang means ‘South Sea’ in Mandarin, and usually references to Southeast Asia. The Singapore coffee is recognized to be culturally significant and part of the everyday diet and lifestyle of many Singaporeans. It is habitual for Singaporeans of all ethnicities and ages to customize their Kopi using the Hokkien dialect. The coffee is also popular in Malaysia. The Singapore coffee is distinct from other types of coffee due to its roasting process and preparation technique involving a variation of the Torrefacto method. It is usually served in coffee shops, Hawker centres and kopitiams. There are also many commercial brands that have emerged specializing in serving the traditional coffee with pairings of local fare such as kaya toast and laksa. Concerns over the elevation of diabetes cases, have caused the creation of government-led nationwide campaigns in Singapore to reduce sugar intake, especially with regard to sweet drinks or drinks that add sugar such as Kopi O. This has the potential to affect the consumption of Kopi O. The significance of Kopi in Singapore's culture can be found in greater detail in Singapore's only Kopi museum.
