What to eat
Standard breakfast fare is the Hainanese-Western half-boiled eggs, kaya toast and coffee set. You’re supposed to break your own very runny eggs into a bowl and season them to taste with soya sauce. Kaya is coconut jam made from coconut, eggs and sugar.

At the original Killiney Kopitiam outlet in Killiney Road, it’s mandatory for your server to slop approximately one quarter of your coffee into the saucer. We also enjoy the heart-stopping screech of orders being relayed from serving to kitchen staff – preparing the adrenals for the imminent jolt of caffeine, perhaps.

We tend to prefer the kaya toast at Yakun: light brown instead of soft white, each slice of bread is toasted, then split into two thin, crispy halves that are sandwiched with a spread of kaya and a couple of generous slabs of cold butter. That said, we’ve had our best-ever kopi and kaya toast at Good Morning Nanyang Café at Chinatown Point.

And for an East Coast hangover, you can’t beat the addictively spicy chicken curry at Killiney Kopitiam in Siglap. Along with a cup or two of whatever form of kopi takes your fancy, it’s guaranteed to set you to rights.
