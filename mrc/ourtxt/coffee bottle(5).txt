A gentle way of making coffee since the water is just shy of boiling when it combines with the grounds. The lower temperature allows for the coffee to brew more delicately, which doesn't over-extract the flavor.

How it works: Water is heated until it turns into vapor and passes upwards into a round carafe filled with coffee grounds. Once the vapor turns back into water and combines with the grounds, it releases back into the carafe used to heat the water and create a vacuum, which strengthens the coffee's aroma and flavor.

Who it's best for: Coffee geeks who love science and want to maximize the flavor of their coffee in the most advanced way.

Percolators existed long before drip coffee machines. They produce flavorful cups of coffee with a strong aroma. Some can be used on the stove, while others are electric.

How it works: Heated water passes through a tube and repeatedly saturates coarse coffee grounds located on the top of the machine.

Who it's best for: Those who really like hot coffee.
