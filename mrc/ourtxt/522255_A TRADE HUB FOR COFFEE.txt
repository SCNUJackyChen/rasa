SINGAPORE: A TRADE HUB FOR COFFEE
Singapore also holds an important role as a trade hub in the coffee sector. It is a free port which has free trade agreements with 26 different countries and blocs. Around 50,000 international brands have a presence on the island.

Altogether, this means that Singapore is an ideal link between major coffee producing and coffee consuming markets – both in Asia and further afield.

“Singapore is a huge transhipment coffee centre for the whole Asia-Pacific region,” Victor explains. “[This is because of its] free trade status, banking and insurance facilities, [nature as a] logistics hub, excellent port and air cargo facilities, and the presence of international coffee traders.” 

Victor adds that the two main trading partners (in terms of coffee production) are Indonesia and Vietnam. However, he also acknowledges that coffee trade with Latin America has increased in the last couple of years. 

“As a trading hub, Singapore is able to enhance the specialty coffee sector in the whole Asia Pacific,” he says.

Steven Tan is the Executive Director of the Singapore Coffee Association. “Singapore has excellent [transport] connectivity on an international scale by both air and sea,” he says. “There are also robust financial systems that support the coffee trade in the country. 

“It also has a great number of free trade agreements with many different nations and markets. This facilitates easier trade and business across borders.

“Furthermore, the growth of the specialty coffee segment in Southeast Asia is gaining attention on a global scale. With 655 million people, a vast majority of which are 40 or younger, the region is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world.”
