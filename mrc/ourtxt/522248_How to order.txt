How to order
By default, a coffee or kopi (say ‘kaw-pee’) comes with condensed milk and sugar at the bottom of the cup. Or you can ask for:

Kopi: Black Coffee with condensed milk
Kopi Peng: Sweet black coffee with condensed milk and ice
Kopi O Siew Dai: Black coffee with less sugar
Kopi-O: Sweet black coffee
Kopi-Kosong: Unsweetened black coffee
Kopi Kosong Peng: Unsweetened black coffee with ice
Kopi-O Peng: Sweet black coffee with ice
Kopi Gah Dai: Black coffee with extra condensed milk
Kopi Po: A weaker coffee with condensed milk
Kopi Gau: Strong coffee with condensed milk
Kopi-C: Coffee with unsweetened evaporated milk (the C is for Carnation); but they’ll still add sugar
Kopi Ta Bao: To-go

To really sound like a local, order ‘kopi sua’ – two regular coffees.
Terminology:
O: Black with sugar
C: With evaporated milk and sugar instead of condensed milk
Kosong: No sugar or milk added
Gah Dai: Extra condensed milk
Xiu Dai: Less sugar
Po: Thinner coffee
Peng: Iced
