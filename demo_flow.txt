########### 流程4 咖啡知识问答 ###########
###### Case 1  ###############
Your input ->  chitchat
Ask me anything about coffee!
Your input ->  what is kopi?
Let me think...
Kopi: Black Coffee with condensed milk
Your input ->  is coffee good for health?
Let me think...
A 2016 meta-analysis showed that coffee consumption was associated with a reduced risk of death in patients who have had a myocardial infarction.
Your input ->  what goes best with Kopi for breakfast?
Let me think...
Standard breakfast fare is the Hainanese-Western half-boiled eggs, kaya toast and coffee set. 
You’re supposed to break your own very runny eggs into a bowl and season them to taste with soya sauce. Kaya is coconut jam made from coconut, eggs and sugar.
